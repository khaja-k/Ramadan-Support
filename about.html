        <h2>About Ramadan Support</h2>
        <p class="auto-style1">Ramadan Support is a heartfelt initiative dedicated to helping those in need during the holy month of Ramadan. We believe that no one should face hunger or hardship during this sacred time. Through food packs, family sponsorships, and the dedication of volunteers, we strive to bring hope, nourishment, and joy to families and individuals in need.

Our mission is simple yet profound: to embody the spirit of Ramadan by fostering compassion, unity, and generosity. Together, we can make a differenceâ€”one meal, one family, and one act of kindness at a time.</p>
